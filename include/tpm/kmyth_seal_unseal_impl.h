/**
 * @brief Seal data using TPM 2.0.
 *
 * Sealing both encrypts the data and binds the ability to later unseal it
 * to a "policy" consistent with user-specified criteria (e.g., PCR state).
 * This function takes in all of the parameters needed to seal
 * a data blob. It does not handle file I/O. It takes input data,
 * in the form of hex data bytes (uint8_t *), and seals it to the TPM 2.0.
 *
 * @param[in]  sapi_ctx          System API (SAPI) context, must be initialized
 *                               and passed in as pointer to the SAPI context
 *
 * @param[in]  sdo_data          Input data (e.g., symmetric wrapping key) to be
 *                               sealed - pass pointer to input plaintext buffer
 *
 * @param[in]  sdo_dataSize      Size, in bytes, of the input plaintext data
 *
 * @param[in]  sk_handle         Handle value for the storage key in the
 *                               hierarchy this data is to be sealed under
 *
 * @param[in]  sk_authVal        Authorization value to be used for creating this
 *                               object (satisfy SK authorization policy)
 *
 * @param[in]  sk_pcrList        PCR Selection List used by the policy authorizing
 *                               use of this object (satisfy SK auth policy)
 *
 * @param[in]  sdo_authVal       Authorization value to be applied to the auth
 *                               policy for the newly created sealed data object
 *
 * @param[in]  sdo_pcrList       PCR Selection List to be applied to the auth
 *                               policy for the newly created sealed data object
 *
 * @param[in]  sdo_authPolicy    Authorization policy digest that should result
 *                               when completing the steps for the newly created
 *                               sealed data object's auth policy completely and
 *                               correctly
 *
 * @param[in]  sdo_policyBranch1 Optional policy branch to be used in the
 *                               calculation of a compound "policy or" policy
 *
 * @param[in]  sdo_policyBranch2 Second optional policy branch to be used in the
 *                               calculation of a compound "policy or" policy
 *
 * @param[out] sdo_public        TPM 2.0 sized buffer to hold the returned 'public
 *                               area' structure for the sealed data object
 *
 * @param[out] sdo_private       TPM 2.0 sized buffer to hold the returned
 *                               'private area' struct for the sealed data object
 *
 * @return 0 on success, 1 on error
